# Code out of Masterarbeit of Yannick Fritsch

This code includes data preprocessing (see notes why needed), an overview of the calendar ageing and the cyclic ageing.
The directory with the log files of the battery cycler should be specified in the configuration script.

## The preprocessing folder is only informational, the provided dataset already contains the data that is preprocessed

## Use with caution, still need to fix things
